## Oracle Licensing Overview

There are 3 types of licenses for the Oracle Database: Packs, Options and Features and 9 Oracle Database Offerings: Standard Edition 2, Enterprise Edition, Oracle Database Appliance, Exadata, Exadata Cloud Service and Cloud@Customer, Database Cloud Service Standard Edition, Database Cloud Service Enterprise Edition, Database Cloud Service Enterprise Edition – High Performance and Database Cloud Service Enterprise Edition – Extreme Performance (you can see their abbreviations in the table below).

I always like to use the Oracle internal provided APEX tool to check the related Oracle packs, options and features. 

There are multiple approraches to understand Oracle licensing and compare with other cloud vendor or database vendors.
