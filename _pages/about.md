Welcome to my blog! My name is Royce Fu, and I am the Master Principal Cloud Architect with Oracle North America Gen AI Data Platform Engineering. I have a diverse background and experience across IT infrastructure operations, engineering, and architecture. As a member of the Oracle Database Certified Masters, I have deep expertise in Oracle Database Technologies, OCI Observability and Management, and Gen AI Data Platform Engineering, Architecture, and Integration. I began my career as a software engineer, and have spent over a decade specializing in database and system integration engineering and architecture.

My current work centers on the convergence of data, cloud, and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on AI Operations (AIOps) and AI Security. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiency and proactively secure modern data platforms.

I created this blog to share insights, experiences, and the latest developments from the world of data, cloud, and AI. Whether you are an architect, engineer, technologist, or simply interested in the fast-changing landscape of IT, AI, and databases, I hope you find the content here valuable and inspiring—especially around the areas of AI-driven operations and security.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you enjoy reading the posts as much as I enjoy creating them!
